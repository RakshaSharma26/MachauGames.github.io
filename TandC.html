        <p>Hello! Welcome to The Lost Mystic Ornament’s Terms and Conditions. By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed
            to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. This game is
            a proprietary app of Machau Games.</p>
        <p>Machau Games is committed to enrich the in-game experience as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its
            services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
        <p>The Lost Mystic Ornament game stores all game data to your device only, we don’t collect personal data from your end. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or
            root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
            security features and it could mean that The Lost Mystic Ornament app won’t work properly at all.</p>
        <p>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app</p>

        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Machau Games will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile
            network provider, but Machau Games cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
        <p> If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the
            duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
            region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Certain Services may allow you to “earn” or “purchase”
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency);</li> or
                <li>certain in-game benefits ("Virtual Items”).</li>
            </ol>
            Virtual Items have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for actual currency, goods or other items of monetary value, including in the event that you have unused Virtual Items remaining in your account at the time your account is closed, whether
            such closure was voluntary or not. All sales of Virtual Items are final. No refunds will be given .The price of any product or service purchased through the Services will be the price specified at the time of your purchase. Prices for all
            products and services exclude all applicable taxes and telecommunication charges, unless otherwise indicated. To the extent permissible by law, you agree to be responsible for any such applicable taxes and telecommunication charges.</p>
        <p>Your purchase of any App, Virtual Item or other content through the Services constitutes your representation and warranty that you are of legal age to form a binding contract, and if not of legal age, that you have placed such order with the permission
            of a parent or legal guardian, and that you are not a person barred from using or receiving the Services by any local, state, federal or international law.</p>
        <p>The purchase of any Virtual Item is merely the purchase of a license to use the Virtual Item in the applicable Services and does not transfer ownership of that Virtual Item to you.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Machau Games cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Machau Games
            cannot accept responsibility. With respect to Machau Games’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
            we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Machau Games accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the
            app.
        </p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download
            the updates if you want to keep using the app. Machau Games does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise
            to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li> the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;</li>
                <li>you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

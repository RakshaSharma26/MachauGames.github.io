            Virtual Items have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for actual currency, goods or other items of monetary value, including in the event that you have unused Virtual Items remaining in your account at the time your account is closed, whether
            such closure was voluntary or not. All sales of Virtual Items are final. No refunds will be given, except in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>

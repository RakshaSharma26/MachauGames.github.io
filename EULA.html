        <h4>Virtual Items</h4>
        <p>Certain Services may allow you to “earn” or “purchase”
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

            </ol>
            Virtual Items have no real-world value and cannot be redeemed for actual currency, goods or other items of monetary value, including in the event that you have unused Virtual Items remaining in your account at the time your account is closed, whether
            such closure was voluntary or not. All sales of Virtual Items are final. No refunds will be given, except in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
        <p>The purchase of any Virtual Item is merely the purchase of a license to use the Virtual Item in the applicable Services and does not transfer ownership of that Virtual Item to you.</p>
